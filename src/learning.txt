Some notes / some of the new things I learned in the making of this project:

- passing 'e' as a parameter on a function to have the event of something happening,
allowing us to know plenty of information about the event, in this case I was
interested in the event's target, and the target's value (input forms)


-The use of computed properties [written in square brackets] to pass 
reference/overwrite property names of objects (For setting State, in this case)
without giving the object a new property with the variable name, but instead, 
value of that variable as a prop name. --->
const propName = 'firstName'
const name = 'Agu'
const secondPropName = 'likes'
const like = 'coffee'
const person = { [propname]: name, [secondPropName]: like }

If we console log'd the person object, we would get the following:

Obj {
    firstName: 'Agu',
    likes: 'coffee'
}


-Conditional inline styling of an element by passing a style={object}

-How much easier and cleaner it is to handle State for a component's children
on its parent and nowhere else.

-Potentially cleaning up all the CSS Into one file, and making the 3 State
handling functions into only one generic "handleChange" function. (would require
baking the 3 diff States into one)
